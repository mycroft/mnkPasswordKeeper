Install: 
* get a working Qt (Version used: 4.4.1) installation;
* ./build.sh 
* copy mnkPasswordKeeper, fileclose.png and *.qm files in the same target 
  directory (mine: $HOME/bin).
* default password file is "passworddb.xmls". It is read on common working dir.
* I use a simply but efficient shell script to run it:
#!/bin/sh

cd ~/bin
./mnkPasswordKeeper &
cd -
* The default Master password for the passworddb.xmls is "default".

Notes: dockwidget is too large. Can't resize it due to a bug in Qt, which may
be fixed in Qt 4.4.0.
